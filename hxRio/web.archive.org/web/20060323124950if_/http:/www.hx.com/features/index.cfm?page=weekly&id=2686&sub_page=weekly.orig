Ipanema</i></b>

<p><i>by Glenn Greenwald</i>

<p>Along with cities such as Havana and Paris, Rio 
de Janeiro in the 1950s defined international 
glamour and luxury, attracting jet-setters and 
adventurers alike. After suffering a few decades of 
political turmoil and widespread poverty, Rio is 
now experiencing a booming resurgence, becoming one 
of the most popular destinations for the gay 
traveler.

<p>And it’s easy to understand why: With perfect 
tropical weather year-round, stunning beaches, a 
friendly and festive population, a wild gay scene, 
a super-liberalized sexual climate, a vibrant and 
culturally diverse metropolis, sprawling mountains 
and rain forests, and men whom many believe to be 
the most beautiful on Earth, Rio is as close to 
heaven for the gay traveler as one can imagine. 
Plus, Brazil’s weak currency and still struggling 
economy make everything in Rio shockingly 
inexpensive for the Western tourist.

<p><b>Lay of the Land</b>
<br>The first thing you notice is the city’s 
breathtaking and truly unique physical beauty. Rio 
is surrounded by mountains and the Atlantic Ocean. 
Its interior is comprised of rolling hillsides and 
lakes. And filling the gaps between these 
wonderments of nature is a complex and 
sophisticated metropolis, comprised of 
architecturally unique buildings and colorful 
residential neighborhoods.

<p>The wonderment of Rio lies in its diversity. You 
can relax at a sprawling, tranquil tropical beach 
one minute, and the next minute dine at one of the 
city’s countless exotic restaurants - or hike in a 
rain forest, or shop on Ipanema’s fashionable Rua 
Visconde de Piraja, or admire the city’s truly 
innovative architecture, or hop from nightclubs to 
theaters to bars and saunas. Best of all, these 
wildly disparate places are literally within 
walking distance of each other.

<p><b>The Cariocas People</b>
<br>Residents of Rio, or “Cariocas” as the 
Portuguese-speaking population call themselves, are 
striking in every way. Because Brazilians descend 
from multiple races, their physical appearance is 
exotic and truly distinct. But the aesthetic appeal 
of the Carioca is only the beginning of their 
charm. While many people associate Rio with the 
wild festivities of Carnival, the life of a Carioca 
year-round is that of pleasure and relaxation, with 
parties, celebrations and beach get-togethers part 
of the standard routine. Perfect strangers speak to 
each other with the warmth and intimacy of life-
long friends.

<p><b>The Gay Scene</b>
<br>“Even as recently as five years ago, Rio’s gay 
scene was similar to those of American cities in 
the 1960s. It was hidden and suppressed,” says 
Curtis Jacobs, a New Yorker who moved to Rio last 
year and is now the owner of Rio Gay Guides, which 
provides English-speaking, gay Brazilian guides for 
American travelers in Rio. “But with the growing 
acceptance of homosexuality throughout Brazil, the 
gay scene has really taken off and now rivals any 
city in the world.”

<p>The center of gay life is Ipanema, a 
neighborhood in Zona Sul (South Zone), which is 
Rio’s more upscale and touristy area. (Trend-
setting designer Philippe Starck is building an 
über-chic hotel there.) The street Rua Farme de 
Amoedo is considered the “gay street” because it 
extends into Ipanema from the gay part of Ipanema 
Beach, which is located at Posto 9 (there are 
“posts” on the beach with increasing numbers - 
that’s how Brazilians identify the areas of the 
beaches - and the center of gay life is at Posto 9. 
You’ve probably heard of the neighborhood from the 
classic 1960s bossa nova song “The Girl From 
Ipanema.” Today, a popular restaurant on the gay 
strip bears this name.

<p>The Copacabana neighborhood, right next to 
Ipanema, is a little older and seedier, although it 
boasts a lot of the city’s nicest and most well-
known hotels and buildings because it was the 
glamour district in Rio’s heyday.

<p>Unlike New York, there aren’t that many gay 
bars, per se. The largest and most popular by far 
is Le Boy, located on the Ipanema-Copacabana 
border. It offers go-go boys, working boys, loud 
music and tons of hot guys especially on Tuesdays, 
Fridays and Sundays. Its New York equivalent would 
be Splash.

<p>The other popular bar is Cine Ideal in Centro 
(downtown), popular on Friday and Saturday. It’s 
the place to be seen for super-hot, chic, pretty 
boys. 

<p>Whether or not you’re into the nightlife scene, 
Rio offers endless diversions, fascinating 
possibilities and truly fulfilling encounters. And 
November through February is the most popular time 
to visit, so pack your bags and escape Gotham’s 
gloomy winter.

<p><hr><p><b>Brazilian Boys</b>
<p><i>Sex tourism thrives in Rio thanks to popular 
saunas and legalized escorts

<p>Text by David Miranda
<br>Photography by Sidney Fernandes</i>

<p>Services are now popping up to help gay American 
travelers maximize their Rio adventures. Curtis 
Jacobs is a New Yorker who moved to Rio last year. 
His company, Rio Gay Guides 
(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060323124950/http://www.riogayguides.com/" target="_blank">
RioGayGuides.com</a>), provides English-speaking 
male Brazilian guides to help Western tourists 
navigate Rio’s sex and sauna scenes as well as to 
enjoy the city’s ample non-sexual charms. 

<p>“Most people in Rio only speak Portuguese, so it 
helps to have a native guide to take you to the 
sights, find the right beaches and hidden 
restaurants, and help you find what you want in the 
saunas and clubs,” Jacobs says. “Our guides make 
sure that the client doesn’t get ripped off or fall 
into bad situations. The fact that our guides are 
hot and very open-minded about helping the tourist 
find what he wants makes them even more appealing.”  

<p><b>Working Boy Saunas</b>
<br>Escorting in Brazil is legal. And jobs in Rio 
are scarce. Moreover, sexuality there is much more 
fluid than in the States, with the lines separating 
straight, bi and gay being blurry. As a result, 
guys of all types - from married policemen to 
college sophomores, gay, straight and bi - frequent 
the saunas. 

<p>Two of the most popular “working boy” saunas are 
located in Copacabana - Point 202 and Estaco. The 
largest gay working sauna, by far, is Club 117, 
located in Gloria (next to downtown). It is 
sprawling, with more than 100 working guys during 
its peak hours. The saunas, usually open from 3pm 
till 2am, have bars, restaurants, dancing and  
entertainment. Their popular weekend drag shows 
attract a young crowd. And the spacious cabins 
include VCRs and large-screen TVs. It’s more like 
an exciting sex club than, say, a dingy, depressing 
bathhouse. 

<p><b>Passion for Passion</b>
<br>“Some tourists think that because a lot of the 
working guys are straight or bi, they will just go 
through the motions because they are doing it for 
the money,” Jacobs says. “But that’s not how 
Brazilians are. They are passionate people who are 
very open sexually, and they immerse themselves in 
all activities of pleasure. Everyone who arranges 
an encounter with a working guy in Rio walks away 
impressed and fulfilled.”  

<p>Jacobs should know. He also runs an escort 
agency, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060323124950/http://www.riomaleescorts.com/" target="_blank">RioMaleEscorts.com</a>, catering to 
American and European tourists. “By being able to 
provide our clients with the hottest guys in Rio as 
escorts, and the most charming and knowledgeable 
boys as guides, we ensure that they get the full 
Rio treatment safely and in a hassle-free way.”
