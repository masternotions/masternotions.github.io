equipment are changing the gay porn 
industry</i></b>

<p><i>Text by Glenn Greenwald
<br>Photography by Joe Oppedisano for HX </i>

<p>Only in his early 20s, Jonathan Dubuque is 
already a successful and increasingly prolific porn 
producer. What makes Dubuque’s success so striking 
is that he does not use - and does not even own - 
the items that the large XXX studios deem to be 
absolutely necessary for producing and marketing 
successful gay porn.

<p>Dubuque uses no porn stars, scripts, costumes or 
plots; nor does the director instruct guys to act 
as the top or the bottom. He does not have teams of 
editors to incorporate the latest trendy editing 
techniques into his sex scenes, nor does he hire 
the large lighting, sound and camera crews who 
populate the set of every video made by the large 
studios.

<p>What Dubuque does have - and, he will tell you, 
all he needs to make great porn - is a couple of 
digital video cameras, a set of lights and the 
ability to find “real” guys who have never before 
done porn and to persuade them to have uninhibited, 
wild, unscripted sex while Dubuque films it.

<p>These days, Dubuque’s straightforward, no-frills 
method of making porn is hardly unusual. To the 
contrary, the market for this type of porn is 
exploding. Just as reality television programs have 
overtaken fictionalized shows, consumers seem to be 
yearning for more reality porn like Dubuque’s.
As a growing number of people get their hands on 
digital cameras and are able to produce a flood of 
real sex videos, an entire industry is being 
created to provide an outlet for these videos.

<p>One of the earliest and most aggressive 
promoters of this porn has been New York-based 
StudMall.com, which devotes itself exclusively to 
promoting and distributing hard-core, non-studio, 
reality porn. “Some people call it amateur porn. We 
don’t,” said Stud Mall founder Jordan Moore. “More 
than anything, our porn is ‘reality porn.’”

<p>Moore says he created Stud Mall because he was 
not finding the videos he wanted. “For me, good 
porn is like good sex. Actual sex is hottest when 
it’s spontaneous, unpredictable, unscripted and 
edgy. Sex with another person is boring - even 
horrible - when it’s routine, predictable and, 
worst of all, fake. Exactly the same is true for 
sex videos.”

<p>Stud Mall now promotes and distributes Dubuque’s 
videos, along with a growing roster of young porn 
producers devoted to keeping porn videos free from 
contrived acting, plots, pre-scripted sex and 
intrusive production values. The creation of 
companies like Stud Mall has now provided a way for 
this new breed of porn filmmakers to find their 
audience.

<p>From the 1970s onward, virtually all gay porn 
was produced by a handful of large porn studios 
that monopolized the industry and churned out title 
after title featuring recognizable porn stars, 
vaguely enacted plots and a handful of obligatory 
costumes. But affordable digital cameras and 
editing software are clearly - and rapidly - 
changing the industry. “What is happening,” Moore 
says, “is nothing less than the democratization of 
gay porn. It is changing the entire industry.”

<p>Dubuque, who once worked for a large porn 
studio, explains that “once I found Stud Mall and 
knew that I had a company devoted to the kind of 
porn I wanted to make, I was free to make 
innovative, unscripted, uninhibited porn and know 
that the people who want these types of videos 
would be able to find them. That has let me push 
the limits more and more as I try to make videos 
that have that real edge that I think porn 
consumers want.”

<p>Moore points out that because the cost to 
produce “reality videos is a fraction of the cost 
of studio videos, reality porn producers can also 
offer very specific fetish videos that are wildly 
popular among those devoted to that fetish.” He 
continues: “The guys who produce videos for us are 
genuinely into the sex they are showing, as are the 
guys in the videos. They are not acting. They make 
these videos because they got hot having that sex, 
not because they are being told to act like they’re 
getting hot. For guys into real, specific fetishes 
and sex, that makes all the difference in the 
world.”

<p>Perhaps the one downside to the consumer is that 
so much porn is being produced that it’s hard to 
differentiate the quality from the garbage. Moore 
says that is why he created his company. “I spend 
most of my day reviewing videos that are sent to us 
by new producers, everyone from students in their 
20s to retired pilots in their 50s, wanting us to 
distribute their videos. Some of it is awful, most 
of it is mediocre, and some of it blows me away. 
The stuff that is truly awesome ends up on our 
site, and we believe that those videos are going to 
change the way porn is viewed, marketed and 
consumed.”

<p>Judging by the enthusiasm among porn consumers 
for this new type of reality porn, the changes 
Moore predicts may, in fact, already be occurring.

<p><hr><p><b><i>Give It Your Best Shot</i></b>

<p><i>Stud Mall offers Do and Don’ts for Making 
Reality Porn</i>

<p><b>DO</b> find guys who, based on pictures you 
show them, are into each other before pairing them 
in front of the camera.
<br><b>DON’T</b> let the guys meet before filming 
to “practice” or “test each other” out; let the 
initial explosions occur once the filming starts.
<br><b>DO</b> make the focus of the videos the sex, 
sex and sex. 
<br><b>DON’T</b> forget about the sound. If you’re 
shooting in New York, <i>close your windows!</i> 
Nothing is worse than the sound of hot sex being 
drowned out by sirens, passing buses and couples 
fighting next door. 
<br><b>DO</b> take pictures. They will sell your 
video when it’s completed. But don’t take them 
during the shoot.
<br><b>DON’T</b> dress guys up in plumber costumes, 
police uniforms, construction outfits or anything 
else worn by the Village People or 10-year-old boys 
on Halloween.
<br><b>DO</b> treat your performers with respect 
and pay them fair. It’s good karma.
<br><b>DON’T</b> have bottoms pretend to be tops, 
or tops pretend to love being pounded, or guys who 
aren’t into a certain kind of sex pretend to like 
it. Fake sex is the worst, and so are fake sex 
videos!
