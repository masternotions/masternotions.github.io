This promotional piece for _Hairy Studs Video_ ran in New York's premier gay magazine in 2003.
At the time, Andrew Sullivan was one of the most famous gay journalists in America; no one had heard of Glenn Greenwald.

As the sidebar indicates, "Hairy Studs" were not normally featured in HX. Some readers likely thought it was a promotion for soft furnishings.
